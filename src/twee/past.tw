        "Fall 2024": '<strong>Introduction to Creative Writing [CRW 150]</strong><br><small>This course offers an introduction to formal analysis of contemporary creative writing, a study of its techniques and conventions, and an exploration of various genres in our own works. We covered poetry, short fiction, and creative nonfiction via workshops conducted without contribution from the author. This culminated in the curation of a creative writing portfolio from our works that semester.</small><<nobr>><div class="flirt-choice-item">[[Whipped Cream]]</div><div class="choice-item">[[It\'s Alive and It Hates You.]]</div><div class="choice-item">[[Jester\'s Critique of "Cage"|Cage]]</div><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/Creative%20Writing%20Portfolio%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pdf">Creative Writing Portfolio (PDF)</a></div><</nobr>><strong><br>First-Year Composition [ENG 101]</strong><br><small>My English 101 course was uniquely structured to enable our exploration of various forms of writing. We completed three low-stakes draft assignments (personal narrative freewriting, film analysis, and interview-based research), and selected one to finalize. I chose to revise one of my personal narrative freewrites into a more polished creative nonfiction piece.</small><div class="choice-item">[[The Creature]]</div><strong><br>First-Year Experience [FYE 103]</strong><br><small>This course is designed to offer an introduction to the collegiate mindset and the tools needed to thrive in a higher learning environment. Having already explored such a mindset and developed such skills through my collegiate-level experiences before the start of my own college journey, I had little need for this. With that in mind, it is rather impressive that I managed to still extract benefit from the experience by using it to build understanding of and empathy towards those new to a post-secondary environment, and these skills have helped me in my mentoring journey.</small><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://www.maricopa.edu/students/first-year-experience" target="_blank">MCCCD FYE Program</a></div>',
        "Spring 2025": '<strong>Introduction to Writing Fiction [CRW 170]</strong><br><small>This course was entirely dedicated to the exploration of the process of writing short fiction from the prewriting stage through to the revision stage. We workshopped our two synthesis assignments in a more collaborative style, freeing the author to contribute to the discussion. This style of workshop has benefits and downsides compared to the author remaining silent, but it was beneficial to experience a range of styles.</small><<nobr>><div class="flirt-choice-item">[[Amanda Snapped]]</div><div class="choice-item">[[The Bounce]]</div><</nobr>><br><strong>First-Year Composition [ENG 102]</strong><br><small>This course was focused almost entirely on a semester-long research project. It was broken into various smaller chunks, and we had a few assignments related to rhetorical structural and convention in technical writing, as well as a library-led research session, but the underlying focus at all times was on our final project. This research paper collected a semester of research and revision into a concise, structured report, and served as a good refresher for best practices in academic research and its presentation. I chose to research linguistic phenomena in queer individuals and communities.</small><div class="choice-item">[[Lavender Tongue]]</div><br><strong>Introduction to Critical Reading and Thinking [CRE 101]</strong><br><small>This course provided an opportunity to demonstrate command of logical chains of reasoning and critical analysis of varied readings and synthesis of writings evaluating these sources for accuracy, rhetorical strength, and logical validity. The course culminated in a project to present an explanation of a sampling of logical fallacies via curated video examples. I chose to focus on well-known internet videos to leverage audience recognition and augment understanding.</small><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/powerpoint/Logical%20Fallacy%20Project%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pptx">Logical Fallacy Project (PPT)</a></div><br><strong>Survey of Computer Information Systems [CIS 105]</strong><br><small>This course forced me to break from my comfort zone and refresh my masteries of various technologies I have a preference against, including the Microsoft Office suite of software tools, database queries via SQL, and Game Development via the Unity3D editor. I prefer Google\'s cloud-based GSuite, non-structured NoSQL, and FOSS Godot respectively, but this course strengthened my skills with the more commonly-used solutions. During the course, we were prompted to create a simple PPT presentation about our favorite game character, and while I struggle to decide on my favorites, my newfound mastery of the \'Morph\' transition has improved the quality of my visual aids in all academic presentations I have given since.</small><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/powerpoint/Favorite%20Game%20Character%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pptx">Favorite Game Character (PPT)</a></div>',
        "Fall 2025": '<strong>Peer Mentor Training [CPD 250]<br></strong><small>This course is offered exclusively to those participating in PVCC\'s unique <a href="https://www.paradisevalley.edu/peer-mentor-program" target="_blank">Peer Mentor Program</a>. It teaches predominant theory and practical application of peer leadership skills, preparing students to help other students in a formal academic environment. As Peer Mentors, we are expected to embody the principles of academic excellence, engage actively with our college community, and to make ourselves available to share advice, resources, and strategies associated with our own academic excellence amongst out peers. This course culminated in an evaluation by our partner instructors and a final lesson presented to the class.</small><<nobr>><div class="flirt-choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/powerpoint/I%20Hate%20The%20Word%20Burnout%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pptx">I Hate the Word Burnout.

In my enduring pursuit of perfection, I often struggle to operate at a safer, more traditional level, and this course provided an opportunity to improve in this area. We researched techniques for, drafted outlines/manuscripts of, and presented an autobiographical speech, an informative speech, a persuasive speech, and a tribute speech, each with its own successive self reflection.</small><<nobr>><div class="flirt-choice-item">[[Poe endures]]</div><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/powerpoint/A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Prisons%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pptx">A Tale of Two Prisons (PPT)</a></div><div class="choice-item">[[COM 225 Self Reflections]]</div><</nobr>><br><strong>Art History: Prehistoric - Gothic [ARH 101]</strong><br><small>This course offered a broad overview of the history of art, its purposes, its social and cultural role, and its many varied techniques throughout the major historical eras of its existence. Most notable in terms of coursework artifacts, we were provided unique opportunities to demonstrate our understanding at the conclusion of our units on neolithic and paleolithic art, ancient Egyptian art, and ancient Greek art (though the latter involved comparison to ancient Egyptian and near-eastern art as well).</small><<nobr>><div class="choice-item">[[Art in the Stone Age]]</div><div class="flirt-choice-item">[[Art in Ancient Egypt]]</div><div class="choice-item">[[Art in Ancient Greece]]</div><</nobr>><br><strong>Introduction to Sociology [SOC 101]</strong><br><small>This course was uniquely impactful for me, as it enabled me to connect much of my previous thinking, research, and philosphy to the sociological nature they always embodied. While this inherently means that none of these have directly changed, this recontextualization came with an inventory of theoretical terminology and concepts by which I can more accurately and effectively communicate them.</small><div class="choice-item"><a href="https://jesterlumos.github.io/downloads/powerpoint/Sociology%20Portfolio%20-%20Jester%20Lumos.pdf">Sociological Portfolio (PDF)</a></div>',

<h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1><small>This section highlights a curated sampling of Jester's countless extracurricular activites.</small>

<strong>ASU x PVCC 20 Poems in 20 Days</strong>
<small>Towards the beginning of 2025, PVCC partnered with ASU in a challenge to students modelled after Michael Bierut's <a href="https://designobserver.com/five-years-of-100-days/" target="_blank">100 Days Challenge</a>. We contributed our pieces to a shared repository, workshopped each other's pieces, revised, and then performed a selection of our works from the challenge at ASU's West campus. I performed the pieces listed below.</small>

<strong>Paradise Valley Community College Peer Mentor</strong>
<small>I was nominated for and accepted into the Peer Mentor in the fall of 2025 due to outstanding peer leadership skills one of my instructors noticed during his course. The program has been an outstanding opportunity for me to hone my leadership skills and meaningfully improve the academic lives of my peers to an extent I had previously only dreamt of, and I will remain eternally grateful for everyone involved in allowing me this chance.</small>

<strong>Paradise Valley Community College Creative Writing Club</strong>
<small>I joined the CRW club at PVCC in 2024, and remained a member through 2026. I workshopped multiple of my own pieces with this club, organized workshop sign-ups and digital resources, provided feedback and advice to other writers in the community, and participated in numerous events on and off campus, including the 20 Poems in 20 Days challenge with ASU.</small>

<strong>Paradise Valley Community College Tabletop Games Club</strong>
<small>I joined the Tabletop Games club at PVCC in 2024 (then known as D&D club), and remained a member through 2026. I attended multiple meetings and particpated in the restructuring of the club.</small>

<strong>Paradise Valley Community College Fine and Performing Arts</strong>
<small>As a FPA student at PVCC myself, I attended countless performances at our Center for the Performing Arts (CPA). As part of the FPA program, students are required to formally attend two such events. I used two nights of our International Film Festival to fulfill this requirement, and my writeups for each are listed below.</small>
