<h2 style="text-align:center;">Art in Ancient Greece</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing the reliefs of the ancient Palmyrene man Zabdibol, son of Mokimu, the 12th dynasty Egyptian sculptor Userwer, and a potter with a partially-inscribed last name, carved by Archaic Greek sculptor Endoios, the Ancient near-eastern, Egyptian, and Greek conceptualizations of the human form are apparent. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, the hierarchical tendency of the ancient near-east can be seen both in the relief itself (with the man of the family sprawled out in luxury and his family standing behind him) and even in the inscription where the man’s lineage is described, but his family is only named in relation to him. Scale is also used to this effect, as was common in art from the period and culture. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Egyptian relief serves as a uniquely illuminating example of the strict canon of proportions in Egyptian works of human sculpture because the grid used to structure the strict form (in this case potentially carved by the memorialized sculptor themself) remains partially visible. It also demonstrates the Egyptian idea of the human form as merely one small part of the complex machinations of society, both in toil and in celebration.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greek relief is less of a prime example of Greek posing and perspective, but it shows the beginnings of Greek sculpture’s evolution. The figure is more stiff than later works, and features a man sitting rather than presenting the peak form of his body, but it breaks from the strict proportionality and fixed standing pose of other works. It shows the man in pretty accurate profile (as opposed to the stylized Egyptian form) with a slight tilt of the head and expressiveness to the face that almost suggests the affect of a real person.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No color survived in any of these three examples, however the ancient Egyptian piece could have used pigments of different colors to identify the figures by gender (white and red specifically), identify connections to certain deities, and even demonstrate cultural beliefs or hint at specific funeral rituals used, as these all were quite common uses. Similarly, ancient near-east pieces were often vibrantly colored, with deep red skin tones, black, textured (especially facial) hair, and striking eyes. Similarly the man and his seat in the Greek piece was once painted with at least blue, yellow, and red pigments, which would’ve helped to truly bring out the physical form of the man’s bare chest in contrast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these elements, I propose that cultures of the ancient near-east used representations of the human form less as representations of people and more as symbols of history, status, power, and the relationship between humanity and divinity. The Egyptian sensibility seems to be quite similar, but with emphasis on the power and geometric beauty of a collection of individuals so unified and driven they could move mountains piece by piece, harvest floods, and build monuments towering towards the gods themselves.
